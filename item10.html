                    <p>
                        Preheat your oven according to the instructions on the cake mix box.
                        Prepare a 9x13-inch baking dish by greasing it or lining it with parchment paper.
                        Prepare the chocolate cake mix according to the package instructions. Typically, you'll mix the
                        cake mix with eggs, water, and oil. Follow the instructions on the box for the specific
                        measurements and mixing directions.
                        Pour the cake batter into the prepared baking dish and bake it according to the package
                        instructions. Use a toothpick or cake tester to ensure the cake is fully cooked. It should come
                        out clean when inserted into the center of the cake.
                        Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for about 10-15 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use the handle of a wooden spoon or a similar tool to poke holes all over the cake. Space the
                        holes about 1 inch apart.
                        Make sure the holes go all the way through the cake but avoid poking through the bottom of the
                        dish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the semisweet chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk.
                        Microwave the mixture in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval until the chocolate
                        chips are completely melted and the mixture is smooth.
                        Pour the chocolate filling over the warm cake, ensuring it seeps into the holes. Spread it
                        evenly with a spatula.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Place the cake in the refrigerator and let it cool and set for at least 1 hour, but overnight is
                        even better. This allows the chocolate filling to soak into the cake and make it extra moist and
                        delicious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a mixing bowl, combine the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract.
                        Whip the mixture until stiff peaks form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Spread the whipped cream topping evenly over the chilled cake.
                        Garnish with chocolate shavings or a sprinkle of cocoa powder if desired.
                        Slice and serve the chocolate poke cake. Enjoy!
