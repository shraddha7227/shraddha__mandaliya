                    <h2><u>instruction:</u></h2>

                    <p>
                        Start by crushing the cardamom pods and lightly crushing the cloves and cinnamon sticks to
                        release their flavors.

                        In a saucepan, add 2 cups of water and all the spices (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, ginger,
                        peppercorns, and any optional spices you choose to include).

                        Bring the water and spices to a boil, and then lower the heat to a simmer. Let the spices simmer
                        for about 5-7 minutes to infuse the water with their flavors.

                        Add the black tea leaves or tea bags to the simmering spiced water. If you're using loose tea
                        leaves, you can tie them in a muslin cloth or use a tea infuser for easy removal later.

                        Let the tea simmer for another 3-5 minutes or until it reaches your desired strength. You can
                        adjust the strength by adding more or less tea leaves.

                        Add 2 cups of milk to the spiced tea and bring it to a boil while stirring occasionally. Be
                        careful not to let it boil over.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the chai comes to a boil, lower the heat and simmer it for another 2-3 minutes. This step
                        helps to meld the flavors of the tea and spices with the milk.

                        Add sugar to taste. Start with 2 teaspoons and adjust according to your preference. You can also
                        use honey if you prefer a different sweetness.

                        Strain the chai into cups or mugs using a fine-mesh strainer or a tea filter.
