                    <p>
                        In a mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour and salt. Mix well.
                        Gradually add water and knead the dough until it's smooth and soft. The dough should be pliable
                        but not too sticky. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a mixing bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, chopped onion, green chilies, minced garlic,
                        cumin seeds, red chili powder, garam masala, coriander powder, amchur (or lemon juice), salt,
                        and chopped coriander leaves (if using). Mix everything well to form a uniform mixture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Divide the dough into equal-sized balls, slightly smaller than the potato filling balls.

                        Take one dough ball and flatten it with your fingers to make a small disc. Place a portion of
                        the potato filling (about 2-3 tablespoons) in the center.

                        Carefully gather the edges of the dough to cover the filling and seal it completely. Roll it
                        gently between your palms to make a smooth ball again.

                        Flatten the stuffed ball gently using your fingers, making sure the filling doesn't spill out.
                        Roll it into a paratha about 6-7 inches in diameter. You can use some dry flour to prevent
                        sticking while rolling.

                        Heat a griddle or tava over medium-high heat. Place the rolled paratha on it.

                        Cook for about 1-2 minutes until you see bubbles forming on the surface. Flip the paratha and
                        cook the other side.

                        Spread a little ghee or oil on the cooked side, then flip again and repeat on the other side.
                        Cook until both sides are golden brown and crisp.

                        Remove the Aloo Paratha from the griddle and place it on a plate.

                        Repeat the process with the remaining dough and potato filling to make more parathas.

                        Serve hot Aloo Parathas with yogurt, pickles, or a dollop of butter. They are best enjoyed fresh
                        off the griddle!
