                        Wash the rice and urad dal separately, and soak them along with
                        fenugreek seeds in enough water for about 4-6 hours. Drain the
                        water from the soaked rice and dal, and grind them separately to a
                        smooth paste using as little water as possible. Mix the ground
                        rice and dal batter together, add salt, and mix well. Allow the
                        batter to ferment for 8-12 hours or until it has doubled in
                        volume. Grease the idli molds with ghee or oil. Pour the batter
                        into the molds, filling them about 3/4 full. Steam the idlis in a
                        steamer for about 10-15 minutes or until they are cooked through.
                        You can check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into an idli –
                        it should come out clean when done.

                    <p>
                        Cook the toor dal in a pressure cooker with enough water until
                        it's soft and mushy. Mash it well and set aside. In a large pot,
                        add the chopped vegetables, chopped onion, turmeric powder, sambar
                        powder, and salt. Add enough water to cover the vegetables and
                        cook until the vegetables are tender. Add the tamarind pulp to the
                        cooked vegetables and let it simmer for a few minutes to blend the
                        flavors. Add the mashed dal to the vegetable mixture and mix well.
                        Adjust the consistency by adding water if needed. In a separate
                        pan, heat the oil for tempering. Add mustard seeds and let them
                        splutter. Then add cumin seeds, asafoetida, dried red chilies,
                        curry leaves, and minced garlic (if using). Sauté for a minute
                        until fragrant. Pour the tempering over the prepared sambar and
                        mix well.
