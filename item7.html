                    <p>
                        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pan or line it
                        with parchment paper.In a mixing bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, baking powder,
                        baking soda, and a pinch of salt. Set this dry mixture aside.In another large mixing bowl, cream
                        the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. This can take about 2-3 minutes
                        using a hand mixer or a stand mixer.To the creamed butter and sugar, add the yogurt, milk, and
                        vanilla extract. Mix until well combinedGradually add the dry flour mixture to the wet mixture
                        and mix until you have a smooth batter.Gently fold in the tutti frutti into the cake batter.
                        Reserve some for garnishing if desired.Pour the cake batter into the prepared cake pan. Spread
                        it evenly. If you reserved some tutti frutti, sprinkle it on top of the batter for garnish. Bake
                        in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out
                        clean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then remove it from the pan and let it
                        cool completely on a wire rackOnce the Tutti Frutti cake has cooled, slice it into pieces and
                        serve. It's perfect with a cup of tea or coffee.
