                    <h2><u>instruction:</u></h2>

                    <p>
                        Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.

                        Sift Dry Ingredients: In a medium-sized bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
                        Sifting helps to remove any lumps and aerate the dry ingredients for a lighter texture.

                        Cream Butter and Sugar: In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and
                        granulated sugar until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This can be done with a hand mixer
                        or stand mixer, or you can even do it by hand with a wooden spoon.

                        Add Eggs and Vanilla: Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated
                        before adding the next. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.

                        Alternate Dry and Wet Ingredients: Add the sifted dry ingredients to the wet mixture in three
                        parts, alternating with the milk. Start and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just
                        combined. Be careful not to overmix; overmixing can lead to tough cupcakes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fill Cupcake Liners: Spoon the batter into the cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds
                        full. You can use an ice cream scoop for even portions.

                        Bake: Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for about 18-20 minutes or until a
                        toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean or with just a few crumbs
                        attached.

                        Cool: Remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the muffin tin for a few minutes.
                        Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

                        Prepare Frosting: In a mixing bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. Gradually add the
                        powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract, and continue to beat until the frosting is smooth and
                        fluffy. If you want to add food coloring, do so at this stage and mix until you achieve your
                        desired color.

                        Frost Cupcakes: Once the cupcakes are completely cooled, frost them with the prepared frosting
                        using a piping bag or a spatula. You can also add sprinkles or other decorations if you like.
