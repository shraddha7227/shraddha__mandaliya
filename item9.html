                    <p>
                        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking
                        mats.

                        Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated
                        sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3
                        minutes with an electric mixer.

                        Add Eggs and Vanilla: Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the
                        vanilla extract.

                        Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking
                        soda, and salt.

                        Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing
                        until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; stop as soon as there are no streaks of flour in
                        the dough.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gently fold in the semi-sweet chocolate chips until they are evenly distributed throughout the
                        dough.

                        Form Cookie Dough Balls: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets,
                        spacing them about 2 inches apart. You can also use a cookie scoop for even-sized cookies.

                        Bake: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the
                        cookies are set and the edges are slightly firm. The centers may still look slightly soft; they
                        will continue to set as they cool.

                        Cool: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer them to a
                        wire rack to cool completely.

                        Enjoy: Once the cookies are completely cooled, enjoy them with a glass of milk or your favorite
                        beverage.
